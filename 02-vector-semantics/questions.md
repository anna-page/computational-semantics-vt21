### 2. Operations on similarities


We have some questions regarding mathematical operations on vectors to derive meaning predictions in part 4. We understand this on a conceptual level, but are wondering about the details.


In the notebook, it says: "We can subtract the normalised vectors for king minus queen and add the resulting vector to man and we hope to get the vector for woman". Would this expressed like this:  `woman = man + (king - queen) `?


Below there is a calculation of  `short = light - (heavy - long) `, which is different from the king/queen example. If it were to follow the same pattern, wouldn't it be  `short = long + (heavy - light) `?
